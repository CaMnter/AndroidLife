     * Implement this to initialize your content provider on startup.
     * This method is called for all registered content providers on the
     * application main thread at application launch time.  It must not perform
     * lengthy operations, or application startup will be delayed.
     * <p/>
     * <p>You should defer nontrivial initialization (such as opening,
     * upgrading, and scanning databases) until the content provider is used
     * (via {@link #query}, {@link #insert}, etc).  Deferred initialization
     * keeps application startup fast, avoids unnecessary work if the provider
     * turns out not to be needed, and stops database errors (such as a full
     * disk) from halting application launch.
     * <p/>
     * <p>If you use SQLite, {@link SQLiteOpenHelper}
     * is a helpful utility class that makes it easy to manage databases,
     * and will automatically defer opening until first use.  If you do use
     * SQLiteOpenHelper, make sure to avoid calling
     * {@link SQLiteOpenHelper#getReadableDatabase} or
     * {@link SQLiteOpenHelper#getWritableDatabase}
     * from this method.  (Instead, override
     * {@link SQLiteOpenHelper#onOpen} to initialize the
     * database when it is first opened.)
